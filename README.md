## Introduction:
  we have created an environment where in various committees of the college can register their candidates and a normal user, after signing up can look for whatever event he wants to organise and henceforth book according to his desired budget, and the event date.
This gives students real world exposure and sharpen their skill sets and rather acknowledge their hobbies as future carrier opportunities.
